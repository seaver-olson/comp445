EdgeLock 2GO MQTT Client

This demo demonstrates how to use MQTT connections to cloud services such as AWS or Azure with preprovisioned keys
and certificates from the EdgeLock 2GO service.

The workspace structure (when building this order must be respected):
- el2go_mqtt_client_s: project running in Secure processing environment (SPE)
- el2go_mqtt_client_ns: project running in Non-secure processing environment (NSPE)

The device on which the example is running must have the secure boot enabled, otherwise the blob verification and
decryption keys can't be derived.

Prerequisites
- Any Serial communicator
- EdgeLock 2GO keypairs and certificates for AWS and/or Azure already imported to the device (ITS).
  This can be achieved via offline provisioning (with el2go_import_blob application) or via online
  provisioning (with el2go_agent_demo_wifi application). Please refer to their repspective readmes on
  how to perform the provisioning and import.

ATTENTION: It is important not to erase the ITS part of the flash (0x83C0000 to 0x83E0000) when flashing this application,
as this is where the EdgeLock 2GO objects are stored.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Provide the EdgeLock 2GO object IDs of the keys and certificates already imported to the device as well as the
    AWS and/or Azure connection parameters in the file middleware/se_hostlib/nxp_iot_agent/ex/inc/iot_agent_demo_config.h
    (the relevant macros are enclosed by "doc: MQTT required modification - start" and "doc: MQTT required modification - end").
    Details on the different configuration options are explained in the file.

2.  Provide the wifi access point credentials

    in file middleware/se_hostlib/nxp_iot_agent/ex/src/network/iot_agent_network_lwip_wifi.c
    #define AP_SSID
    #define AP_PASSWORD

3.  To correctly run the example, the secure boot mode on the device needs to be enabled. The bootheader needs to be removed
    from the SPE image, it has to be merged with the NSPE image and the resulting image must be signed with the OEM key.
    Additionaly, if the example is supposed to run in the OEM CLOSED life cycle, the image needs to be encrypted with
    the OEM FW encryption key and loaded as an SB3.1 container.
    Details on how to execute these steps can be found in the Application note AN13813 "Secure boot on RW61x", downloadable from
    https://www.nxp.com/products/wireless-connectivity/wi-fi-plus-bluetooth-plus-802-15-4/wireless-mcu-with-integrated-tri-radio-1x1-wi-fi-6-plus-bluetooth-low-energy-5-3-802-15-4:RW612
    in the "Secure Files" section.

4.  Compile the projects using the dedicated toolchain in the following order:
    - el2go_mqtt_client_s
    - el2go_mqtt_client_ns

5.  Connect a USB-C cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J10) on the board.
6.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
7. Download the Wifi FW as described in components/conn_fwloader/readme_rc.txt
8. Download the program to the target board. In case the image is signed the base address for downloading
    needs to be adjusted to 0x08001000.
9. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
