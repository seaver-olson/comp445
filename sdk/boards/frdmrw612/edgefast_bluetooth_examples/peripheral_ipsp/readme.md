- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

Prepare BLE controller
Download BLE controller FW according to the document component\conn_fwloader\readme.txt.

Note:
To ensure that the LITTLEFS flash region has been cleaned,
all flash sectors need to be erased before downloading example code.
After downloaded binary to the target board, 
please reset the board by pressing SW1 or power off and on the board to run the application.
Prepare the Demo
================

1.  Open example's project and build it.

2.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.

3.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control

4.  Download the program to the target board.

5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
The demo does not require user interaction. The application will automatically start advertising the IPSP Service and it will accept the first connection request it receives. The application will perform the required setup for the L2CAP credit-based channel specified by the IPSP Profile. The application will display in console any message it receives from the peer through the L2CAP channel. Example output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Received message: hello
Received message: hello
Received message: hello
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
