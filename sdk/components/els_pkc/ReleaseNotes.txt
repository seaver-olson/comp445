--- New Features: 
   - Maintenance release
   
--- Known Issues Limitations:

 --- New Features: 
   - Maintenance release
   
--- Known Issues Limitations:
   - Negative tests which try to provoke an uninitialized PRNG error had to be disabled since ELS_ITERATIVE_SEEDING inherently always initalizes the PRNG (sim_random_ncGenerate_negative, par_ecc_pkc_keygen_rng_error, par_ecc_pkc_sign_rng_error)
   - Cert-C / Coverity static analysis violations to be cleaned up 
   - When MCUXCLECC_STATUS_RNG_ERROR or MCUXCLRSA_STATUS_RNG_ERROR is returned the security counter is not guaranteed to be balanced
