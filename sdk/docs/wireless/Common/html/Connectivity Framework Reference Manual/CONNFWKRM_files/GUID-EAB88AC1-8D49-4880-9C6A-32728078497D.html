    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Deep sleep mode 2 and 3</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Deep sleep modes 2 and 3 are identical. They were both kept for compatibility with
            applications written for earlier platforms. The MCU enters mode 2/3 when both cores have
            entered mode 2/3. Once a core exits low-power mode 2/3, it can wake up the other core
            using ERPC commands conveyed by MU.</p>

        <p class="p"> </p>

        <p class="p">The application core enters LLS in this mode. The amount of RAM retained for the
            application core can be set using PWR_Disable_CM4_RAM_FromAddress function. The possible
            wake-up reasons for the application core are: LPTMR0 and LLWU connected onboard
            switches. The LPTMR0 is also used to measure the time that CM4 spends in deep sleep to
            synchronize low-power timers at wake-up. The deep sleep duration can be configured at
            compile time using cPWR_DeepSleepDurationMs define in PWR_Configuration.h header file or
            at runtime calling PWR_SetDeepSleepTimeInMs(deepSleepTimeTimeMs) function. The maximum
            configurable</p>

        <p class="p">deep sleep duration in this mode is 49.71 days. In case gTMR_EnableLowPowerTimers_d and
            cPWR_CheckLowPowerTimers defines are both true, the application core wakes up by LPTMR0
            on which of the following events comes first: deep sleep duration expires, or the
            nearest low-power timer expires.</p>

        <p class="p"> </p>

        <p class="p">For the connectivity core, this low-power mode is used when all stacks enabled for this
            platform are idle. In this mode, the cm0+ enters LLS and all enabled link layers remain
            idle. The amount of RAM retained for the connectivity core can be set using
            PWR_Disable_cm0_RAM_FromAddress function. The cm0+ wakes up from this mode by LPTMR2
            timeout using LLWU module. The LPTMR2 is also used to measure the time that cm0+ spends
            in deep sleep to synchronize low-power timers at wake-up. The deep sleep duration can be
            configured at compile time using cPWR_DeepSleepDurationMs define in PWR_Configuration.h
            header file or at runtime calling PWR_SetDeepSleepTimeInMs(deepSleepTimeTimeMs)
            function. The maximum configurable</p>

        <p class="p">deep sleep duration in this mode is 49.71 days. In case gTMR_EnableLowPowerTimers_d and
            cPWR_CheckLowPowerTimers defines are both true, the connectivity core wakes up by LPTMR2
