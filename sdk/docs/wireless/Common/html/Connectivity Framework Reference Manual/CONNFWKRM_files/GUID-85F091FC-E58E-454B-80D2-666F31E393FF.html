    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Deep sleep mode 6 low-power mode was developed to save some power while the radio is on.
            Its most common use case is with the radio in RX waiting for a packet. Upon receiving
            the packet, the radio wakes up the MCU. The MCU enters mode 6 when both cores have
            entered mode 6(Actually for this mode the application core can enter mode 1,2,3,6,7. The
            connectivity core has to enter mode 6. This is possible because CM4 in LLS and cm0+ in
            STOP means that the MCU is in STOP).</p>

        <p class="p">In this mode, the application core enters STOP mode. Any module capable of producing an
            interrupt can wake up the CM4, such as onboard switches, LPTMR0 timeout, UART ans so on.
            The LPTMR0 is also used to measure the time that CM4 spends in deep sleep to synchronize
            low-power timers at wake-up. The deep sleep duration can be configured at compile time
            using cPWR_DeepSleepDurationMs define in PWR_Configuration.h header file or at runtime
            calling PWR_SetDeepSleepTimeInMs(deepSleepTimeTimeMs) function. The maximum configurable
            deep sleep duration in this mode is 49.71 days. In case gTMR_EnableLowPowerTimers_d and
            cPWR_CheckLowPowerTimers defines are both true, the application core wakes up by LPTMR0
            on which of the following events comes first: deep sleep duration expires, or the
            nearest low-power timer expires.</p>

        <p class="p">In Deep sleep mode 6, the connectivity core enters STOP mode and the radio maintains its
            state. Any module capable of producing an interrupt can wake up the MCU, such LPTMR2
            timeout, Radio Interrupt and so on. The LPTMR2 is also used to measure the time that
            cm0+ spends in deep sleep to synchronize low-power timers at wake-up. The deep sleep
            duration can be configured at compile time using cPWR_DeepSleepDurationMs define in
            PWR_Configuration.h header file or at runtime calling
            PWR_SetDeepSleepTimeInMs(deepSleepTimeTimeMs) function. The maximum configurable deep
            sleep duration in this mode is 49.71 days. In case gTMR_EnableLowPowerTimers_d and
            cPWR_CheckLowPowerTimers defines are both true, the connectivity core wakes up by LPTMR2
