# 1. General description

<p>The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate the capabilities of the K32W1480 SoC when used as a Zigbee NCP together with a Zigbee Coordinator application running on the iMX8 (or x86) platform under Linux. </p>

<p>The demo showcases how to connect a Zigbee End Device to the network formed by the Zigbee Coordinator and toggle the RGB LED available on the device. </p>

<p>A step-by-step guide to the hardware and software configurations are provided, as well as the steps needed to be executed in order to get the boards up and running.</p>

# 2. Required Hardware

* 1 x iMX8M-EVK board running Linux - Host 

* 1 x K32W148-EVK board or 1 x K32W061 DK6 board – Zigbee NCP coprocessor

* 1 x K32W061 DK6 board - Zigbee End Device 

## 2.1. iMX8 board configuration 

<p>Ensure that SW801 on the IMX8 EVK board is configured for SD card boot.
For more information see the following starting guide for IMX8M EVK board: https://www.nxp.com/document/guide/getting-started-with-the-i-mx-8m-plus-evk:GS-iMX-8M-Plus-EVK. </p>

## 2.2. Zigbee NCP coprocessor board configuration

<p>The Zigbee NCP coprocessor can be either a K32W148-EVK board or a K32W061 DK6 board. After the board is properly configured it should be connected to the iMX8M board using a 
standard micro USB cable that will be also used for power delivery to the board.</p>

### 2.2.1 K32W148 board configuration

<p>For the detailed board configuration, see the “Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for K32W148-EVK.pdf” guide, part of the K32W148 SDK. </p>
<p>Ensure that the debug firmware on the board is J-Link. If this is not the case, follow the steps in chapter 7 of the aforementioned document to update the firmware accordingly.</p>
<p>The board should be updated with the binary image `k32w148evk_zigbee_coprocessor_bm.axf`, image which contains the Zigbee NCP. This image can be obtained from the Zigbee application wireless_examples/zigbee/zigbee_coprocessor, application that is part of the K32W148 SDK.</p>

### 2.2.2 K32W061 board configuration

<p>For the detailed board configuration, see the “Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for K32W061.pdf” guide, part of the K32W061 SDK. </p>
<p>Ensure that the debug firmware on the board is DK6 Flash Programmer. For additional information, please you the aforementioned document together with the 
DK6-UG-3127-Production-Flash-Programmer.pdf document.</p>
<p>The board should be updated with the binary image `k32w061dk6_zigbee_coprocessor_bm.axf`, image which contains the Zigbee NCP. This image can be obtained from the Zigbee application wireless_examples/zigbee/zigbee_coprocessor, application that is part of the K32W061 SDK.</p>

## 2.3. K32W061 board configuration (ZED RX ON)

<p>For the detailed board configuration see the “Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for K32W061.pdf” guide, part of the K32W061 SDK</p>

# 3. Building

<p>The building process has small differences depending on the host (iMX8 or x86) on which the Zigbee Coordinator application is running on. For the x86 platform it allows 
for user configurable options in terms of MCUXPRESSO SDK package and Mbedtls package. The Mbedtls package is required for the encryption/decryption capabilities needed to 
obtain a secured Serial Link.</p>

## 3.1. iMX8 platform 

<p>Create a directory `out` under the `build_linux` directory and issue the cmake command with the `MACHINE=imx8` option. The mbedtls package is preinstalled in the provided 
Board Support Package (BSP).</p>

<p>The user has the option to cross-compile the Coordinator application under x86 Linux distribution. The toolchain to be used should be provided through the `ARMGCC_DIR` 
environment variable.</p>

## 3.2. x86 platform 

<p>The Zigbee Coordinator demo application was compiled and verified on a x86 Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS). The CMakeFile of the application determines as a prebuild step
if the application was provided as part of a MCUXPRESSO SDK package or as standalone Zigbee module. Depending on the SDK package existence, the Mbedtls can be used either from within the SDK package, as a preinstalled package or it can be obtained from official git repository (version 2.28.0). </p>

### Environment Setup

For the x86 platform, the user can provide a MCUXPRESSO SDK path and a method to obtain the Mbedtls package through environment variables:
-   `export NXP_SDK_BASE=/home/mcu-sdk-2.0/` - example on how to provide MCUXPRESSO SDK path
-   `export MBEDTLS_ORIGIN=SDK` - Mbedtls package is obtained from MCUXPRESSO SDK 
-   `export MBEDTLS_ORIGIN=GIT` - Mbedtls package is retrieved from git official repository
-   `export MBEDTLS_ORIGIN=SYSTEM` - Mbedtls package is used as a preinstalled package

### MCUXPRESSO SDK package

<p>Create a directory `out` under the `build_linux` directory and issue the cmake command. The output will showcase the MCUXPRESSO SDK location and the mbedtls usage from within the SDK package.</p>

### Standalone Zigbee module

<p>The Zigbee coordinator application can be obtained and compiled as a standalone application, without the presence of a MCUXPRESSO SDK. The mbedtls package is required as a
preinstalled package or can be configured through user environment variables `export MBEDTLS_ORIGIN=GIT` to be obtained from official repository.</p>

Create a directory `out` under the `build_linux` directory and issue the cmake command.

# 4. Running the application

## 4.1. Starting the coordinator

<p>Make sure that the iMX8 board is connected to the Zigbee NCP coprocessor board as in the picture below. The two boards are connected through a USB cable (micro-USB for K32W148 EVK board and mini-USB for K32W061 DK6 board), between the MCU-Link connected on the K32W148/K32W061 board (marked as such on the silk screen), and the OTG connector on the iMX8 board.</p>

<p>The Linux Zigbee Coordinator allows the user to specify the serial port on which the NCP coprocessor board is connected. Usually on the iMX8 board, this is /dev/ttyACM0 for K32W148 and /dev/ttyUSB0 for K32W061. For the K32W061 based NCP coprocessor, the user should pay attention and modify the default latency timer (255msec) to a smaller value (it should be below 16msec). </p>

Command to display default latency timer for ttyUSB interface: `cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer`

Command to modify default latency timer for ttyUSB interface: `echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer`.

Example to start the Zigbee NCP Coordinator:

```

```

The APP-ZDO Data Indication message signals that an Zigbee End Device has successfully joined the network and is ready to be controlled. 

## 4.4. Find and Bind

<p>Since the Zigbee End Device in this demo is behaving as a light bulb, we need to bind its On/Off cluster (server) to the Zigbee Coordinator On/Off cluster (client) in order to receive reports and be able to toggle it. This is done based on the BDB Find & Bind procedure, where the Zigbee Coordinator is the initiator and the Zigbee End Device is the target. For the first step we’ll use the `find` command, while the `bind` is going to be automatically done by the Zigbee Coordinator, since the On/Off cluster is the cluster of interest.</p>

<p>To kick off the F&B procedure, the user needs to enter the `find` command (case insensitive) into the Zigbee Coordinator console and the corresponding output:</p>

```

>[188612]
>
```

## 4.5. Toggle commands

<p>The Zigbee End Device is sending periodic reports regarding the state of the light (on/off), as well as reports when there’s a change request state from the initiator. In order to change the state of the light, the user needs to enter the command `toggle` (case insensitive) in the Zigbee Coordinator console, as per the example below: </p>
 
```
>[239792] Toggle
>[239792] APP-EVT: Event 5, NodeState=10
>[239792] APP-EVT: Send Toggle Cmd 
>[239792] ZCL Attribute Report: Cluster 0006 Attribute 0000 Value 1
```

## 4.6. ZigBee Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade

<p>Over-The-Air (OTA) Upgrade is the method by which a new firmware image is transferred to a device that is already installed and
running as part of a ZigBee network. Support for the OTA Upgrade cluster as a Server has been included for the Coordinator device.</p>

<p>To add an image to the coordinator, the OTA images must be placed in the `out` directory and must obey the following convention: begin OTA image name with `OTA_Image` and use
a `.bin` file format. For example: OTA_Image_k32w061dk6_zigbee_ed_rx_on_bmClient_UpgradeImagewithOTAHeaderV2_Enc.bin.</p>

<p>Example output for a successful OTA transfer:<p>
