# cns_dac_waveform_generator

## Overview
The DAC waveform generator driver example demonstrates how to use the DAC module to generate different types of waveforms
(including triangle waveform, sawtooth waveform, sine waveform, and noise). After starting this example, user can select
the waveform type based on the log, and then the selected waveform will be output from  DAC channel pin.
