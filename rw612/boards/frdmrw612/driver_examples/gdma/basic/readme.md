# gdma_basic

## Overview
This project shows how to use GDMA functional APIs to do the basic memory to memory
data transfer. In this example, GDMA copies data from one buffer to another buffer,
when copy finished, the two buffer content are compared to make sure the transfer
succeed. The compare result is shown in the terminal.
