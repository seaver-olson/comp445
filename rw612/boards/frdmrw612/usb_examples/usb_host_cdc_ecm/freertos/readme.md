# host_cdc_ecm



## Overview

The host CDC-ECM project is a simple demonstration program based on the MCUXpresso SDK . It demonstrates Ping and UDP echo server, it also join into a multicast group. The application periodically sends the ICMP echo request to a PC and processes the PC reply and always forwarding UDP message on echo port.

## System Requirement

### Hardware requirements

- Mini/micro USB cable
- USB A to micro AB cable
- Hardware (Tower module/base board, and so on) for a specific device
- Personal Computer (PC)

### Software requirements

- The project path is:
<br> <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_host_cdc_ecm/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
> The <rtos> is Bare Metal or FreeRTOS OS.


## Getting Started

### Hardware Settings

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.
> Set the hardware jumpers (Tower system/base module) to default settings.


### Prepare the example 

1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the USB port on the target board with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
2.  Make sure to use a USB HUB or an adapter with OTG functionality firstly. Connect the target board to the external power source (the example is self-powered).
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Power off the target board, then power on again.

> For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

## Run the example

1.  Connect serial port to board and run the example host_cdc_ecm , then plug in USB CDC-ECM device to the board. The log will printed like below:
<br>![Host enumerates CDC-ECM device](device_attach.png "Host enumerates CDC-ECM device")
2.  If network link of CDC-ECM device is up, the example host_cdc_ecm will start DHCP service and join into a multicast group using IGMP. The example host_cdc_ecm will always listening on UDP port 7 and echo message to sender, then start Ping. The log will printed like below:
