    <h1 class="title topictitle1">Deep sleep mode 1</h1>

    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The MCU enters mode 1 when both cores have entered mode 1. Once a core exits
            low-power mode 1, it can wake up the other core using ERPC commands conveyed by MU. The
            application core enters LLS in this mode. The amount of RAM retained for the application
            core can be set using PWR_Disable_CM4_RAM_FromAddress function. The possible wake-up
            reasons for the application core are: LPTMR0 and LLWU connected onboard switches. The
            LPTMR0 is also used to measure the time that CM4 spends in deep sleep to synchronize
            low-power timers at wake-up. The deep sleep duration can be configured at compile time
            using cPWR_DeepSleepDurationMs define in PWR_Configuration.h header file or at runtime
            calling PWR_SetDeepSleepTimeInMs(deepSleepTimeTimeMs) function. The maximum configurable
            deep sleep duration in this mode is 49.71 days. </p>

        <p class="p">If gTMR_EnableLowPowerTimers_d and cPWR_CheckLowPowerTimers defines are both
            true, the application core wakes up by LPTMR0 on which of the following events comes
            first: deep sleep duration expires, or the nearest low-power timer expires. For the
            connectivity core, this low-power mode is used when the Bluetooth LE stack is active. In
            this mode, the cm0+ enters LLS and Bluetooth LE Link Layer enters deep sleep. The cm0+
            wakes up from this mode by LPTMR2 timeout, or by Bluetooth LE Link Layer wake-up
            interrupt (BLE_LL reference clock reaches wake up instance register) using LLWU module.
            The LPTMR2 timer does for cm0+ the same thing LPTMR0 does for CM4. The amount of RAM
            retained for the connectivity core can be set using PWR_Disable_cm0_RAM_FromAddress
            function. There are two ways to use this mode:1. The Bluetooth LE stack decides it can
            enter low power and calls PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep(). </p>

        <p class="p">If no other software entity prevents the system from entering deep sleep
            (all software layers that called PWR_DisallowDeviceToSleep() have called back
            PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep()) and the system reaches idle task, PWR_EnterLowPower function
            is entered and the system prepares for entering low-power mode 1. The Bluetooth LE Link
            layer status is checked and found not to be in deep sleep. A function from Bluetooth LE
            stack is called to get the nearest instant at which the Bluetooth LE Link layer needs to
            be running again and the wake-up instant register in the Bluetooth LE Link layer is
            programmed with this value. The Bluetooth LE link layer is then put in deep sleep and
            the MCU enters LLS.2. The Bluetooth LE stack decides it can enter low power and calls
            PWR_BLE_EnterDSM(wakeupInstant) followed byPWR_AllowDeviceToSleep(). In this way, the
            Bluetooth LE Link layer is put to deep sleep immediately, the MCU remaining to enter LLS
            on idle task. If no other software entity prevents the system from entering deep sleep
            (all software layers that called PWR_DisallowDeviceToSleep() have called back
            PWR_AllowDeviceToSleep()) and the system reaches idle task, PWR_EnterLowPower function
            is entered and the system prepares to complete entering low-power mode 1. </p>

        <p class="p">The Bluetooth LE Link layer status is checked and found to be in deep sleep,
            so the MCU puts itself in LLS and deep sleep mode 1 is finally reached. With a timeout
            calculated as cPWR_BLE_LL_OscStartupDelay + cPWR_BLE_LL_OffsetToWakeupInstant before
            Bluetooth LE link layer reference clock register reaches the value in wake-up register,
            the Bluetooth LE Link Layer wakes up the cm0+ core and the system resumes its activity.
            The two defines above can be found in the cm0+ core’s PWR_Configuration.h header
            file.</p>
