    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">K32w0x2s is the first Kinetis wireless multi-mode dual-core microcontroller
            and consist of an application core(CM4) and a connectivity core(cm0+). As suggested by
            their names, the application code runs on CM4 core and the connectivity stack
            (BLE/802.15.4/Generic FSK) runs on cm0+ core which is the radio module owner. Each core
            has its own low-power library and decides by itself when to enter low power, the
            application core has the means to control the low-power mode of the connectivity core
            and to allow/disallow it to enter low power through a set of commands implemented over
            the ERPC protocol. Since it is the radio module owner, the connectivity core is the one
            which manages the link layers low-power mode enter and exit sequences. Once the
            low-power mode of both cores is configured and they are allowed to enter low power, they
            enter and exit low power independently. </p>

        <p class="p">Each core can wake up the other core using ERPC commands conveyed by the MU
            module. Although, most of the low-power library functions are implemented on both cores
            with the same meaning, each core has its own specific functions so in the following
            paragraphs it will be specified to which core belongs function/configuration define/type
            definition described. If no core is specified, the function/configuration define/type
            definition exists on both cores. The implementation contains different source files and
            interface files for each core, as well as generated ERPC shim files to transport
            information between cores. To have the entire MCU in a low-power mode, the same
            low-power mode must be chosen for both cores. The entire MCU enters a low-power mode
            only when both cores have entered that mode. The MCU power mode is determined by the
            highest one from CM4 and cm0+. For instance if the CM4 is in VLLS and cm0+ in LLS the
            entire MCU is in LLS. If CM4 is in LLS and cm0+ is in RUN mode, the entire MCU is in RUN
            mode.</p>
