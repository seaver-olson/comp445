Attackers can use specialized equipment like antennas to capture the electromagnetic emanations of a keyboard from a distance-even through walls. Once attackers have the signal, they can use signal-processing tools to find patterns in the signals; with these patterns, hackers can retrieve keystrokes from a keyboard leading to exposed sensitive information. The researchers of this paper aimed to use a full spectrum acquistion
